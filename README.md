## Description

    This will be a two-week project. Spend today building a tap room in React where a bar or kombucha store can track their kegs. This could also be a soda fountain or another kind of tracker - as long as you're able to track the remaining amount and meet the objectives, you can be creative with this prompt.

    Before getting started, plan out your application and draw a component tree or component diagram that shows the structure of your components. This is a requirement for the project and should be included in your README. You may draw the structure on a piece of paper and take a picture of it or use an application like https://www.draw.io/.

    Here are some user stories to get you started. The application should have the following functionality:

    * As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).
    * As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
    * As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
    * As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
    * As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
To run this application you will need the following:
* A code editor. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is what I use.
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
### 1) Cloning the Project:
* Find the respository at (https://github.com/NickyLind/Tap-Room)
* Select the green <span style="color:green">'Code'</span> button above the repository and copy the HHTPS link
* In your terminal, find the directory you want to place the `Tap-Room` directory in
* In your terminal, use the git command `$git clone https://github.com/NickyLind/Tap-Room`
* Open in Visual Studio Code or another editor

### 2) Running the project:
* Navigate to the `Tap-Room` directory and build the project with the command `npm install` in the command line to install packages needed to run this project.
* Once the project packages are succesfully installed you may run the command `npm run start` and a browser should automatically be opened to http://localhost:3000/
